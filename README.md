# Analytical-study on Electron Rings in Air showers
## __Overview__
The aim of the project to do an analytical calculation on the electron rings that was observed in the air shower images simulated from the software CORSIKA. The whole idea behind the calculation is an extension on the theory in Air-shower Physics. The work has been published and more details on the background calculation and theory can be seen there ([Publication](https://pos.sissa.it/358/402)).
## __Data Structure__
The data has been simulated using Python using the eqations in Air shower Physics and the ideal values for the constant has been taken from the Particle Data Book ([Publication](https://pdg.lbl.gov)). Each of the equations has been written in separate functions inside the class. Execution of the main file (electron_class.py) has been done using the second file electron_class_execution.py
